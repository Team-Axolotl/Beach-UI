### What is it?

Setting up webpack, react, and all those modules just so you can get a webapp running is incredibly annoying. So much that thousands of projects called 'boilerplates' have risen containing already configured packages. In typical web-developer fashion *(and so I don't fall too behind)* I've created my own! 

This is *Dream* a package containing preconfigured Webpack, Babel, React, Redux, Express, Material-UI, and others. Included is also, a production/development http server switch in the form of a configuration, and a way to communicate with a REST API using Redux, in addition to other quality of life *(my life)* improvements.

### How do I run it?

1. Install node.
2. Download the package.
3. Install dependencies using 'npm install' or yarn.
4. Open up the console and type 'npm start'.
5. Go wild ^^

### Disclaimer

As everyone else I've configured things to my liking. I've added things like being able to import through absolute paths *(well relative to the 'src' directory at least)*, Immutable, and other things not everybody would use. You are free to modify Dream, and use it in any way you want WITHOUT giving anyone or anything credit. *(Module licenses still apply though, duh.)*
